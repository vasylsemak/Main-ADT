## Implement ADT in JavaScript

## Running the Specs

1. `npm install`
2. `npm test`

## Don't use array methods

For Queues and Stacks: don't use array methods push/pop/shift/unshift functions, nor any other Array.prototype methods, nor .length!

You may use an Object or Array to store your data and keep head and tail pointers (variables) that change when functions like enqueue and dequeue are called.
